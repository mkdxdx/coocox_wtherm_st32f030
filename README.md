This is a CooCox project for my weather station based on STM32F030F4P6 controller and ESP-01 wlan module.

Because i could not cram autonomous weather requesting into this chip, there is also python script that updates forecast based on OpenWeatherMap data, so you would have to provide APPID key in order to anything to work.

This is my first srs project on STM32 and that uses ESP-01.
